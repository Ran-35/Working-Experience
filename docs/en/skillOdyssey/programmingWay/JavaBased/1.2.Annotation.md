### Common Annotations

#### 1. `@ConditionalOnProperty`
👉 This is a Spring Boot conditional annotation used to control whether a Bean is loaded based on the value of a property in the configuration file.

**Example**:
```java
@ConditionalOnProperty(prefix = "websocket", name = "switch", havingValue = "1")
```
| Attribute        | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix`         | The prefix of the property. For example, `websocket` → actually matches `websocket.switch`                                             |
| `name`           | The key name of the property. If there are multiple, you can pass an array like `{"switch", "enable"}`                                 |
| `havingValue`    | The Bean is matched only when the configuration value equals this value. The comparison is done as a string by default                 |
| `matchIfMissing` | Whether to match even if the property is missing. `false` means it will not load if missing, `true` means it will load even if missing |

#### 2. @EventListener
👉  The event listener annotation used to listen to specific events in the application. 
**Example:**:
```java
@EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class)
```
This annotation listens for the ApplicationReadyEvent event, which indicates that the application has started and is ready to perform certain actions.
